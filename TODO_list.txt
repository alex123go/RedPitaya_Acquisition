PRIORITY:
	python:
		- make sure there is no unnecessary copy of data_in, which might slow the program


Others : 
	python
		- better format for fft : window + ylabel + linear vs logy + ...
		- when clicking frequency (or time), add the subplot and plot actual data (do not erase actual data)
		- change behaviour when changing channel

	FPGA
		- why is DAC output 1V instead of 0V when DDS turn off?
		- Add trigger on data input -- fill ddr3 continuously (circular buffer) until trigger condition. After condition, record Npts_total-Npts_beforeTrigger. Then, send data along with trigger position offset
