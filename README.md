# RedPitaya_Acquisition
Transform the Red Pitaya in an acquisition card. This software/hardware allows writing data from the Red Pitaya's ADCs to the zynq's internal DDR3-SDRAM and then ploting/saving data in a PC. Data are acquired at full speed (125 MSamples/s) and it's possible to save up to 200Mpts consecutives points (1.6s in single channel mode). It's also possible to acquire both channel in parallel.


# Getting started
This platform is based on a portion of jddes' Frequency Comb DPLL and on a portion of Red Pitaya software. To be able to run the software, you must:

1. Download the lastest SD card image, available at https://github.com/alex123go/RedPitaya_Acquisition/releases
2. Burn the SD card image to the 4GB SD card that came with the Red Pitaya (I suggest to use Win32DiskImager if on windows)
3. Run "MainWindow_AcqCard.py" with python. I suggest to run it with spyder 3.6, which include pyqt5. For MAC users, please refer to the "Instructions and operation manual".

Note: you can also use the noGUIVersion.py to acquire and save data without GUI and plotting.


# Software versions
